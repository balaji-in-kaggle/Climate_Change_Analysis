# Climate_Change_Analysis
This project presents an in-depth data analysis and time series forecasting study on **global surface temperature** and **CO‚ÇÇ emissions**. The goal is to uncover key patterns, understand the impact of greenhouse gases on climate change, and forecast future temperature trends using statistical and machine learning models.

## üîç Key Insights & Findings

- **Data Exploration:** Conducted comprehensive EDA on Global Surface Temperature and CO‚ÇÇ datasets, analyzing data types, missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Used statistical imputation and interpolation to clean the data.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Found a strong correlation between **CO‚ÇÇ emissions** and **rising global temperatures**, confirming CO‚ÇÇ as the dominant contributor to greenhouse gas effects.
- **Time Series Forecasting:** Modeled temperature anomalies using:
  - **SARIMA**
  - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)**
  - **Prophet**
  - Final model: **SARIMAX**, chosen based on performance and reliability.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Revealed that global warming follows a **quadratic trend** (accelerating change) rather than a constant rate.
- **Change Point Detection (CPD):** Identified a significant acceleration in global warming **from 1989 to 2024** using CPD techniques.
